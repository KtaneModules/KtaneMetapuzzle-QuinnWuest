                <p>To solve the module, press the button at the top to enter submission mode and enter the answer to the metapuzzle.</p>
                <p>Once you enter submission mode, you can exit it by pressing the button at the top again.</p>
                <p>A metapuzzle is a puzzle that uses the answers to other puzzles. The metapuzzle on the module has seven different puzzles that feed into it. After solving any of these puzzles, the module will give you an English word for its "answer".</p>
                <p>See Pages 3 and 4 for instructions on how to solve the metapuzzle once you have enough sub-puzzle answers.</p>

                <p><b>You do not need to solve every sub-puzzle to solve the module.</b> You can usually get most of the letters in the metapuzzle answer and then fill in the blanks to get the full answer.</p>
